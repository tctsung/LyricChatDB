it\u2019s pop, \u2019cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make \u2019em lose it\n\nI don\u2019t know how to make songs like that\nI don\u2019t know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I\u2019m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\nIt\u2019s curtains, I\u2019m inadvertently hurtin\u2019 you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to prove\nThat if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too\n\nSchool flunky, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself \u2019cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I\u2019m a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it\u2019s still tongue and cheek, fuck you\nI\u2019m drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I\u2019m asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky\nBut in my head there\u2019s something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here\u2019s what they want from me\n\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\n\nBut fuck it, life\u2019s handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can\u2019t batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon\u2019t mistake it for Satan\nIt\u2019s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a
