The speakers can't even handle me
Give it what I got
Nobody's gon drain my energy
I will never stop
I'm motivated by enemies
Setting up shop
So evеrybody remember mе

Going through life regretfully
I'd rather work non stop
What they call incessantly
Than work some odd job
Just to live life pleasantly
Already got lost

'Cause I'm gaining their attention
'Cause I'm making a connection
Lyricism and aggression
Got me feeling my ascension
In my passion my profession
I'm attacking my obsession
Taking action and progressing ah

Make my plans carefully
Then execute them daringly
They say I act recklessly
But that's why im effective see
You can't predict my tendencies
I offer no transparency

Others think I'll be a legend
And I'm never gunna stop

Are the things you gotta work for believe me
Take into your hands a plan
Your own hands can land
Your own brand and damn
I feel like no one takes accountability
They want the credibility
Convincingly unwilling to
Put in the fucking hours
It takes to get some power
Don't be fucking sour
Take a cold shower
Scream until your louder
Work until your prouder
And fuck all the doubters
They're just fucking downers
I swear to God they all let me down
I always fought just to wear the crown
I'm pissed off at these fucking clowns
Who were all taught they deserve an ounce
It's only worth it if you work for it
It's only worth it if you work for it
I won't stop 'til they hear me now
I won't stop 'til I wear the crown
Fuck fake friends
Fuck my lovers
Fuck this day when i was younger
And they told me i need to shut up
I was lonely but life owned me
Been through shit
Fuck my homies , they showed me to be a junkie
On this day i wouldn’t live
Fuck this shit
Fuck this shit",NEFFEX|||It’s Only Worth It If You Work For It ft. Gianni Music|||308,0

I'm just telling to fight for your dreams
But it's not what it seems
Man it's hard to be seen
When everybody wants to be king
Yeah, they all want a ring
Yeah, we all wanna be free
So show me what you got, what you bring
How you fight in the ring
How you take a fucking swing
Do you got heart are you mean?
Got some scars got some needs
Are you willing to go bleed?

One's real alive while the other is subtle
One is real proud while the other one's humble
One likes to-- while the other one cuddle

She looks so good and promises that she won't tell
